A proof of concept-application for teaching children the Norwegian alphabet, combining sound with tracing letters, preferrably using pen or finger on tablet.
Created for fun for a teacher friend who spends a lot of time and natural resources working the printer :)

How to use:
Select a letter, then the letter sound is played along with the image and sound of an example usage word.
Trace/draw the letter, play back sound, play instruction for drawing the letter, validate tracing, navigate to other tasks. 

Some room for improvement:
- Very slow initial load (bloated app and too much prefetching I assume).
- Validation algorithm and functionality is not good enough.
- Performance on weaker devices using the less-than optimal i chose for the animation in canvas.
- Scaling is a bit off on navigation buttons in drawing screen.
